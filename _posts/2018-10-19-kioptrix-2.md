Kioptrix consists of five capture-the-flag virtual machine challenges. I intend to write about my methodology of solving each of them in time. This is the second. These have been solved many times by people before me, but I feel they represent a good challenge and that documenting my efforts is key to learning.

You can find the VM for download over at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/).

Anyone wishing to run Kioptrix 1.1 in Virtualbox should consult [this setup guide](https://www.hypn.za.net/blog/2017/07/15/running-kioptrix-level-1-and-others-in-virtualbox/).

## My Setup
Currently, I run Kali in a VM using Virtualbox. I have Kioptrix 1.1 and any other CTF VMs on a shared NatNetwork with Kali. This way Kali can access the internet and see the VMs. It also keeps everything behind NAT.

**IP Range:** I have my NatNetwork set with a DHCP server with an IP address range of 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Before we can poke it, we need its address. Both netdiscover and nmap's ping scan work well.

```bash
Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts                 

4 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 4 hosts.   Total size: 240

...
10.0.2.6        08:00:27:c9:82:b4      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
```

I chose to ping 10.0.2.6 to ensure it's our target; I only have Kali and the VM running, so a response means it's our target.

## Port Scanning
Let's see what's available to us over the network using Nmap.
I like to run the following arguments on local VMs:
* -p- | All ports (1-65535)
* -sV | Service Scan, taking guesses at what services are running on the target. Invaluable.
* -A  | OS Detection. Useful, as some exploits are version-dependent.

There's a lot of info, but here's the important parts:
1. OpenSSH 3.9p1 on Port 22.
2. Apache 2.0.52 on Ports 80 and 443
3. RPCBind and Status on Ports 111, 742, 745
4. CUPS 1.1 on Port 631
5. MySQL on its usual Port 3306.

In addition to these, we can see the target is a release of CentOS, with a linux kernel version between 2.6.9 and 2.6.30.

## Apache Webserver
Let's see what Apache in running. Going to the IP directly in Firefox shows a basic login form.

<screenshot of it>

Let's see if this is vulnerable to SQL injection.


## The second page.
Bypassing the login form reveals a form that lets us ping a machine on the network. This doesn't seem to have a useful purpose, so we're probably meant to use this to run something else, a la Command Injection.

Trying the bash semicolon separator lets us run a command in addition to ping.

<ping 127.0.0.1; whoami>
<screenshot of it showing ping and "apache">

## Getting a shell
Let's set up netcat on our end to catch the shell coming from the target.

<netcat command>

We can use the tried and true bash redirection shell, like so.
It's courtesy of <page>

Voila! We can now run commands on the system as Apache.

Now, let's investigate the target some more.

## Determining CentOS release
<command to get release info>

So, we're running CentOS 4.5. Let's see if we can find an exploit for it.

There's a privilege escalation exploit that it's vulnerable to.
<link>

I have tried to use wget to grab it from ExploitDB, but even with telling it not to check the certificate, it won't download.

So let's host it on our Kali machine and wget it from there.

<kali>
wget exploit
spawn webserver using simplehttpserver

<target>
wget from attacker IP
gcc it
run it

Now we're running as root. Let's hunt for the flag.
cd /
ls
cd /root
ls

There it is
cat proof.txt
