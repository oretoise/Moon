Kioptrix consists of five capture-the-flag virtual machine challenges. I intend to write about my methodology of solving each of them in time. This is the second. These have been solved many times by people before me, but I feel they represent a good challenge and that documenting my efforts is key to learning.

You can find the VM for download over at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/).

Anyone wishing to run Kioptrix 1.1 in Virtualbox should consult [this setup guide](https://www.hypn.za.net/blog/2017/07/15/running-kioptrix-level-1-and-others-in-virtualbox/).

## My Setup
Currently, I run Kali in a VM using Virtualbox. I have Kioptrix 1.1 and any other CTF VMs on a shared NatNetwork with Kali. This way Kali can access the internet and see the VMs. It also keeps everything behind NAT.

**IP Range:** I have my NatNetwork set with a DHCP server with an IP address range of 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Before we can poke it, we need its address. Both netdiscover and nmap's ping scan work well.

```bash
Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

4 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 4 hosts.   Total size: 240
_____________________________________________________________________________
  IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
10.0.2.6        08:00:27:c9:82:b4      1      60  PCS Systemtechnik GmbH
```

I chose to ping 10.0.2.6 to ensure it's our target; I only have Kali and the VM running, so a response means it's our target.

## Port Scanning
Let's see what's available to us over the network using Nmap.
I like to run the following arguments on local VMs:
* -p- All ports (1-65535)
* -sV Service Scan, taking guesses at what services are running on the target.
* -T4 Quick timing, but not overly aggressive.
* -sS Stealth SYN scan.
* -O  OS Detection.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS 10.0.2.6
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-10-31 15:27 EDT

```

There's a lot of info, but here's the important parts:
1. OpenSSH 3.9p1 on Port 22.
2. Apache 2.0.52 on Ports 80 and 443
3. RPCBind and Status on Ports 111, 741
4. CUPS 1.1 on Port 631
5. MySQL on its usual Port 3306.

In addition to these, we can see the target is running a release of CentOS.

## Apache Webserver
I ran searchsploit for Apache 2.0.52, but only a DOS showed up.
Let's see what Apache in running. Going to the IP directly in Firefox shows a basic login form.

### Investigating Manually

</figure>

Given the age of this VM, it wouldn't surprise me if there was an SQL injection vulnerability present.

### SQL Injection
Swisskyrepo has a repo with a lot of SQL injection commands listed [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20injection#authentication-bypass).

I tried several that started with 'admin' under the Authentication Bypass section, and the first that worked for me was "admin' #".

I'll show the PHP code on the target that explains why this works when we get there.

## The second page.
Bypassing the login form reveals a form that lets us ping a machine on the network. This doesn't seem to have a useful purpose, so we're probably meant to use this to run something else, a la Command Injection.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_ping.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Ping a Machine, it says</figcaption>
</figure>

Trying the bash semicolon separator lets us run a command in addition to ping.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_ping_cmd.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>127.0.0.1 ; ls</figcaption>
</figure>

We can see the output of ls right below that of ping.

From here, we can run cat on the two files--index.php and pingit.php and see why they're vulnerable to SQL injections and command injections respectively.

### index.php
Getting the ping page to cat index.php gives us the PHP portion and HTML code, which the browser renders.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_cat_index.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>cat index.php</figcaption>
</figure>

If we view the source of this, we can get a bit more. I cut out the HTML, as it's not important.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_cat_index_source.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The unrendered source.</figcaption>
</figure>

There's a couple things here. First, it's apparent that the MySQL credentials are hard-coded into the connection function.  This would let us log into MySQL and see what all is there.

The importart part of the SQL injection is this line:

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password='$password'";
```

When we entered "admin' #", we turned the statement into this:

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' #' AND password='$password'";
```

This effectively turned everything after 'admin' into a MySQL comment, negating the need to enter a valid password.

Looking at the rest of the PHP code, MySQL returns the row from the users table where the username is admin. This passes the if statement further down, showing the "Basic Admin. Web Console"

### pingit.php
<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_cat_pingit.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Ping & More</figcaption>
</figure>

When the form is submitted, it prints the input (the 'ip' POST variable), and sets $target equal to it.
Then it concatenates the ping command with the $target variable.

So, it's pretty obvious to see from this that we can run any command we choose, so long as we prepend "127.0.0.1;" before it.

## Getting a shell
It'd be nice to have an interactive shell, and since we can run any command we choose, let's set up a simple reverse shell using the ping form.

First, we set up netcat to listen on our end.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop# nc -nlvp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

We can use the tried and true bash redirection shell, courtesy of [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)

You'll need to change the IP and port to match where you want it to go. For my setup, just the IP needs to be changed, and the port needs to match what you choose to give NetCat up above.

Once the ping command finishes, we have our shell:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_rev_shell_success.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Successful Reverse Shell</figcaption>
</figure>

Voila! We can now run commands on the system as Apache, without using a slow web shell.

From here, we'll want to enumerate as much as possible about the target machine. We know from Nmap that the target is running CentOS, but what version?

## Determining CentOS release
We can use this command to find the release information: "cat /etc/*-release"

In CentOS's case, it's /etc/redhat-release, but that command will pick up any of them.

This gives us CentOS release 4.5. We also ought to know the kernel version. A quick "uname -a" gives us 2.6.9-55.EL.

## Kernel Fun
Using "searchsploit centos 2.6" gives a few options, but adding in the CentOS version gives only one, Exploit-DB 9542.

Kali keeps a local copy of the ExploitDB. We can either download it directly on the target via our Apache-shell, or we can host it on Kali and wget it from there. It's up to you.  I have tried to use wget to grab it from ExploitDB, but even with telling it not to check the certificate, it won't download.

So let's host it on our Kali machine and wget it from there. There's a really handy utility called SimpleHTTPServer installed on Kali. We can invoke it with the python command below.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop# cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux_x86/local/9542.c 9542.c
root@kali:~/Desktop# mkdir kioptrix_2
root@kali:~/Desktop# cd kioptrix_2
root@kali:~/Desktop# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Back on the reverse shell, we'll wget and compile it.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/k2_root_shell.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Successful Reverse Shell</figcaption>
</figure>

And we have a root shell! I checked /var/mail/root, since that's where the flag was on Kioptrix 1, but this didn't turn up anything.

## Conclusions
The second Kioptrix machine proved to be a bit more challenging than the first. It also serves as a good introduction to SQL injection, command injection, and introduces reverse shells and privilege escalation.

Greatly enjoyed it, and highly recommended.
