Raven 2 is the sequel to the first Raven CTF by William McCann. It's intended to be a bit more difficult than Raven 1.

As usual, you can find it at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-2,269/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## Discovery
Using Nmap's built-in ping scan for this, as per usual. To avoid similar issues as Raven 1, I went ahead and added the VM as 'raven.local' to my /etc/hosts file in Kali.

Ping scanning may be unnecessary given the hosts file addition, but just to show:

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-14 10:05 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:12:DB:1A (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.10)
Host is up (0.00022s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.48 seconds
```

## Port Scan
This should quickly become second nature to you.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS raven.local
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-14 10:07 EST
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.10)
Host is up (0.000095s latency).

```

Same as last time, just SSH and a webserver.

## Tube #80
Without some idea of credentials, let's poke the webserver.

Pointing Firefox to it, it's the same fancy site as Raven 1.

As with most CTFs, look through the website's source code to reveal comments, javascript code, and other things. In this case, I found some links to other pages, and a wordpress installation.

I did not find anything of note in about.html or team.html; however, I did find the first flag in service.html, much like Raven 1.

note: raven2 requires the phpmailer vuln
as well as bypassing the client-side js email validation
use it to spawn a reverse shell

grab mysql pass (can assume wp needs db)

and they used the root password for it

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'R@v3nSecurity');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

root:R@v3nSecurity

Need to go from MySQL root to local root
