Raven 2 is the sequel to the first Raven CTF by William McCann. It's intended to be a bit more difficult than Raven 1.

As usual, you can find it at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-2,269/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## Discovery
Using Nmap's built-in ping scan for this, as per usual. To avoid similar issues as Raven 1, I went ahead and added the VM as 'raven.local' to my /etc/hosts file in Kali.

Ping scanning may be unnecessary given the hosts file addition, but just to show:

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-14 10:05 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:12:DB:1A (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.10)
Host is up (0.00022s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.48 seconds
```

## Port Scan
This should quickly become second nature to you.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS raven.local
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-14 10:07 EST
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.10)
Host is up (0.000095s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
111/tcp   open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
46889/tcp open  status  1 (RPC #100024)
MAC Address: 08:00:27:9A:E0:14 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.59 seconds
```

Same as last time, just SSH and a webserver.

## Tube #80
Without some idea of credentials, let's poke the webserver.

Pointing Firefox to it, it's the same fancy site as Raven 1.

</figure>

As with most CTFs, look through the website's source code to reveal comments, javascript code, and other things. In this case, I found some links to other pages, and a wordpress installation.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven2/links.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Links to other pages on the webserver.</figcaption>
</figure>

I did not find anything of note in about.html or team.html; however, I did find the first flag in service.html, much like Raven 1.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven1/service_html.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The first flag. It's even the exact same one as Raven 1.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Wordpress again
On Raven 1, I ran wpscan to enumerate the wordpress installation. I reran the scan to see if anything is different.

```bash
root@kali:~# wpscan --url http://raven.local/wordpress -e

I'd need to rescan Raven 1 to see if the uploads directory was enabled. That aside, the only file is flag3.png!

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven2/flag3.PNG" alt="">

</figure>

Last time, michael used his username for his SSH/user password. No luck this time. Steven's known password from last time has also changed.

## The contact form
The remaining item to check out from the website is its contact form. Looking at the source, we can see some client-side validation on the email address input.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven2/contact_form_validation.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Note the pattern attribute on the email input field.</figcaption>
</figure>

Burp will bypass that. Upon testing the form with a passable email address, the response indicates a 404 error that the action, mail.php, isn't there.

Let's get burp set up and poke around. If you're not familiar, set your browser proxy to localhost:8080 and Burp's proxy will catch requests, enabling client-side validation bypassing, request editing, etc.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven2/burp.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Burp catching the contact form request.</figcaption>
</figure>

It's not uncommon for simple sites to use the same PHP file to act as both the form and the form's request handler. Let's see what happens if we change the action to contact.php.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/raven2/burp_sent.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Burp catching the contact form request.</figcaption>
</figure>

For starters, we get an HTTP 200 OK status. More importantly, looking through the resulting HTML, a message has been added below the form stating "Message has been sent.".

## PHPMailer
In real engagements, you'd do well to reuse things you found before on existing systems. In Raven 1, there's evidence of a PHPMailer vulnerability, but it was not needed. In this case, it seems our only hope of getting user access on the machine. Let's give it a try. The vulnerability is an argument escape in the system call in PHPMailer that can lead to writing an arbitrary file to disk. We can leverage that to write a PHP reverse-shell inside /var/www/html.

note: raven2 requires the phpmailer vuln
as well as bypassing the client-side js email validation
use it to spawn a reverse shell

grab mysql pass (can assume wp needs db)

and they used the root password for it

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'R@v3nSecurity');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

root:R@v3nSecurity

Need to go from MySQL root to local root
