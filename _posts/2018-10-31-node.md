Node is a CTF made by Rob Carr (rastating). Instead of relying on publicly available exploits, it features multiple security misconfigurations, a custom binary, and quite a few false leads along the way. It's marked as intermediate, and I feel that's accurate.

Kioptrix, while older, served as a good introduction to Find->Scan->Exploit. Node takes this further, in that you have use everything you can find to make smaller, more incremental steps.

## VM Setup
I'll be attacking this with Kali in VirtualBox.  Kali and Node are both on a NAT Network, with an IP range of 10.0.2.0/24.

## Discovery
I prefer Nmap's Ping Scan rather than netdiscover, but both work fine.
