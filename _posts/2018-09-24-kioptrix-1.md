# Kioptrix Level 1
Kioptrix consists of five capture-the-flag virtual machine challenges. I intend to write about my methodology of solving each of them in time. This is the first (and easiest). These have been solved many times by people before me, but I feel they represent a good challenge and that documenting my efforts is key to learning.

You can find the VM for download over at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/).

Anyone wishing to run Kioptrix 1 in Virtualbox should consult [this setup guide](https://www.hypn.za.net/blog/2017/07/15/running-kioptrix-level-1-and-others-in-virtualbox/).

## My Setup
Currently, I run Kali in a VM using Virtualbox. I have Kioptrix and any other CTF VMs on a shared NatNetwork with Kali. This way Kali can access the internet and see the VMs. It also keeps everything behind NAT.

*Note: I have my NatNetwork set with a DHCP server with an IP address range of 10.0.2.0/24*

## VM Discovery
We'll need to get the IP address of the target before we can interact with it.

{% highlight bash %}
root@kali:~# netdiscover -r 10.0.2.0/24

{% endhighlight %}

## Port Scanning
Let's see what's available to us over the network using Nmap.
I like to run the following arguments on local VMs:
* -p- | All ports (1-65535)
* -v  | Verbose, for showing open ports while the scan is running. Optional if you're not in a hurry.
* -sV | Service Scan, taking guesses at what services are running on the target. Invaluable.
* -A  | OS Detection. Useful, as some exploits are version-dependent.

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

Gleaning the important information from that reveals the following:
1. OpenSSH 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99) Server running on port 22.
2. Apache 1.3.20 (Red-Hat/Linux) with mods:
    * mod_ssl 2.8.4
    * OpenSSL 0.9.6b
3. Samba on Port 139
4. rpcbind running a "status" service on port 32768

We'll investigate these in more detail shortly.

## Enumeration 4 Linux
Enum4Linux is another enumeration tool to reveal as much information as possible from a Linux target.

Others have had luck with enum4linux identifying the Samba server version against this VM, but I've had no such luck.

## Service Investigation
### OpenSSH

### Apache

### Samba
If you aren't aware of [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/), it contains many exploits, scanners, and other wonderful tools. We're going to make use of its Samba scanner.

{% highlight bash %}
root@kali~# msfconsole
...
msf > grep smb search scanner
...
auxiliary/admin/smb/check_dir_file                                                        normal  SMB Scanner Check File/Directory Utility
...
auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version                                                         normal  SMB Version Detection

{% endhighlight %}

*Note: I used 'grep smb search scanner' to filter the results of 'search scanner' to only those with 'smb' in them.*

The bottom one is what we want to use, as we want to know the version of the Samba (SMB) server.

{% highlight bash %}
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version):

   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----       ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                      yes       The target address range or CIDR identifier
   SMBDomain  .                no        The Windows domain to use for authentication
   SMBPass                     no        The password for the specified username
   SMBUser                     no        The username to authenticate as
   THREADS    1                yes       The number of concurrent threads
{% endhighlight %}

The important piece is RHOSTS, our target.

{% highlight bash %}
msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > set RHOSTS 10.0.2.6
RHOSTS => 10.0.2.6
msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[.] 10.0.2.6:139          - Host could not be identified: Unix (Samba 2.2.1a)
[.] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[.] Auxiliary module execution completed
{% endhighlight %}

And there's our target's Samba version: 2.2.1a.

### rpcbind / status

## Finding the flag

## Conclusions

More enumeration via enum4linux
Not much in here, but to check Samba version, will try MSF's samba scanner.
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version

Set RHOSTS to our VM at 10.0.2.6

Running it revealed Samba 2.2.1a

Used searchsploit to find exploits

searchsploit samba 2.2

The last one looked promisng
"Samba < 2.2.8 (Linux/BSD) - Remote Code Execution | exploits/multiple/remote/10.c"

Copied the file to pwd, ran gcc on it, then a quick
./a.out 10.0.2.6
worked great. Instant root.
