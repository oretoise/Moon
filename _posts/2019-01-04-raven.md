Raven is a blah blah blah

VM can be downloaded at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-1,256/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Nmap's ping scan is my goto for this.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-03 11:46 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:7F:98:2D (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.9)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.21 seconds
```

## Port Scan
I really ought to automate this.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS 10.0.2.9
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-03 12:01 EST
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.9)
Host is up (0.000090s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)

111/tcp   open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.48 seconds
```

Nothing much to go off here, so let's check out that Apache server.

## Coming into Port (80)
Viewing the source of the available web pages yields the first flag in service.html: <!-- flag1{b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d} -->

Busting out the directory buster one more time.
```bash
root@kali:~# dirb http://10.0.2.9

They have a nifty website (with a LOT of javascript). There's a wordpress install on /wordpress.

## Set phasers to WPScan
Enumerate, enumerate, use -e.

I ran into issues using the direct IP, as it seems wordpress depends on the hostname being used. I added the VM's IP to my hosts file as 'raven.local' and was able to continue.

```bash
root@kali:~# wpscan --url http://raven.local/wordpress -e

Perhaps the most interesting results are the two users: michael and steven.
I thought to use WPScan to do a password brute-force attack using the rockyou.txt wordlist, but it proved too slow.
Only thing I know to do at this point is try to SSH with those two users.

But, we have no passwords, only wordlists. Enter Hydra.

```bash
root@kali:~# hydra -l michael -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 6 ssh://10.0.2.9
Hydra v8.6 (c) 2017 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

Top tier password choice right there.

Let's login as michael and see what we can do.

## SSH (Michael)
Upon login, I'm greeted with a message saying I have new mail. Running cat on /var/mail/michael shows some interesting things. I'm not exactly sure where each message begins, but I've cut to the interesting bits.

X-Mailer: PHPMailer 5.2.17 (https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
```

Several things of note here:
1. The recipient is 'admin@vulnerable.com'. A hint of sorts?
2. There's a warning stating that www-data set the sender to something weird using the force parameter.
3. The message itself contains PHP code that decodes that base64 string and evaluates it.
4. PHPMailer is version 5.2.17
5. The From address mentions a "OQueueDirectory" and an oddly-named PHP file in /var/www/html.

Doing a bit of googling, it looks like this is the remains of an email PHPMailer sent to localhost (raven.local VM).

Need a LPE
