# Kioptrix 3

Kioptrix 3 is the third of five VMs in the Kioptrix line. True to the author's word, it is quite different from the first two. This one involves exploiting a web application rather than a known vulnerability.

VM can be downloaded at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Nmap's ping scan is handy for this. Just use the -sP flag with your desired IP range.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k3# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-28 15:10 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:0E:07:C0 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for kioptrix3.com (10.0.2.12)
Host is up (0.00014s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 2.05 seconds
```

The VM is 10.0.2.12 for me.

## Port Scan
While it mentions a web app, we might as well see if there's anything else.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k3# nmap -p- -sS -sV -T4 10.0.2.12
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-01-28 15:12 EST
Nmap scan report for kioptrix3.com (10.0.2.12)
Host is up (0.000091s latency).

```

Nothing much to go off of here. Even if PHP was vulnerable, we'd need to write a file to the server to take advantage of it.

### Hosts
Before we go on, the VM requests we add the VM's IP address as "kioptrix3.com" to the hosts file.

## La Galerie
The hompeage mentions a new gallery CMS.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/homepage.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Ligoat Security homepage.</figcaption>
</figure>

So, as the homepage want, let's cut to the chase and view the "new gallery".

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/gallery.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The new gallery.</figcaption>
</figure>

If we poke around, it's possible to view individual images, recent photos, total views, etc. Aside from the images, one thing to always be on the lookout for, especially with older or easier CTFs, is the possibility for SQL injection.

Looking at the "Ligoat Press Room" gallery, there's a photo sorting option down in the lower left.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/sorting_options.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Photo sorting</figcaption>
</figure>

When we click this, it updates the URL with some additional parameters.

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/url.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Update URL, now with PHP_GET</figcaption>
</figure>

## SQL Injection Method
If you're new to SQL injection, one of the best tools (if a little noisy) is SQLMap. Let's run the new URL through it and see if it can automatically detect the vulnerability.

```bash
root@kali:~# sqlmap -u http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1&sort=filename#photos
[1] 5730
root@kali:~#         ___
       __H__
 ___ ___["]_____ ___ ___  {1.3#stable}
|_ -| . [(]     | .'| . |
|___|_  [.]_|_|_|__,|  _|
      |_|V          |_|   http://sqlmap.org

```

As you can see, it identified the 'id' parameter within the URL. In addition, SQLMap ran some automated tests and got some back-end server information. We can give a couple arguments to SQLMap to grab some more info from the database.
